## Demo

[![fsql.gif](./fsql.gif)](https://asciinema.org/a/120534)

## Setup / installation

Requires Go to be [installed](https://golang.org/doc/install) and [configured](https://golang.org/doc/install#testing).

Install with `go get`:

```console
$ go get -v github.com/kshvmdn/fsql/...
$ which fsql
$GOPATH/bin/fsql
```

Or, install directly via source:

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/kshvmdn/fsql.git $GOPATH/src/github.com/kshvmdn/fsql
$ cd $_ # $GOPATH/src/github.com/kshvmdn/fsql
$ make install && make
$ ./fsql
```

## Usage

fsql expects the query as a command line argument.

### Query syntax

In general, each query requires one or more attributes, one or more source directories, and a condition.

```sql
SELECT attribute, ... FROM source, ... WHERE conditonal
```

#### Attribute

Currently supported attributes include `name`, `size`, `mode`, `time`, or `*` (for all).

#### Source

Each source should be a relative or absolute path to some directory on your machine. You can also use environment variables (e.g. `$GOPATH`) or `~` (for your home directory).

Use `-` to exclude a directory. For example, to exclude `.git`: `"... FROM ., -.git/ ..."`.

#### Condition

##### Conjunction/Disjunction

Use `AND` / `OR` to join conditions. Note that precedence is assigned based on order of appearance.

This means `"WHERE a AND b OR c"` is **not** the same as `"WHERE c OR b AND a"`. Use parentheses to get around this behaviour, `"WHERE a AND b OR c"` **is** the same as `"WHERE c OR (b AND a)"`.

##### Negation

Use `NOT` to negate a condition. This keyword **must** precede the condition (e.g. `"... WHERE NOT a ..."`).

Note that wrapping parentheses with `NOT` is currently not supported. This can easily be resolved with [De Morgan's laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Morgan%27s_laws). For example, `... WHERE NOT (a AND b) ...` is the same as `... WHERE NOT a OR NOT b ...`.

##### Condition Syntax

A single condition is made up of 3 parts: attribute, comparator, and value.

###### attribute

A valid attribute is any of the following: `name`, `size`, `mode`, `time`.

###### comparator

Comparators depend on the attribute.

For `name`:

  - `=` - Strings that are an exact match.
  - `<>` - Synonymous to using `WHERE NOT ... = ...`.
  - `LIKE` - For simple pattern matching. Use `%` to match zero, one, or multiple characters. Check that a string begins with a value: `<value>%`, ends with a value: `%<value>`, or contains a value: `<value>`.
  - `RLIKE` - For pattern matching with regular expressions.

For `size` and `time`:

  - `>`
  - `>=`
  - `<`
  - `<=`
  - `=`
  - `<>`

And, for `mode`:

  - `IS`

###### value

If the value contains spaces and/or escaped characters, wrap the value in quotes (either single or double) or backticks.

The default unit for `size` is bytes. To use kilobytes / megabytes / gigabytes, append `kb` / `mb` / `gb` to the size value (e.g. `100kb` for 100 kilobytes).

Attribute `mode` only has 2 supported values: `DIR` (to check that the file is a directory) and `REG` (to check that the file is regular).

Use the following format for `time` values: `MMM DD YYYY HH MM` (eg. `Jan 02 2006 15 04`).

### Examples

List all files & directories in Desktop and Downloads that contain `csc` in the name:

```sh
$ fsql "SELECT name FROM ~/Desktop, ~/Downloads WHERE name LIKE %csc%"
$ # this is equivalent to:
$ fsql "SELECT name FROM ~/Desktop, ~/Downloads WHERE name RLIKE .*csc.*"
```

List all JavaScript files in the current directory that were modified after April 1st 2017 (try running this on a `node_modules` directory, it's fast :sunglasses:).

```sh
$ fsql "SELECT name, size, time FROM . WHERE name LIKE %.js AND time > 'Apr 01 2017 00 00'"
```

List all files named `main.go` in `$GOPATH` which are larger than 10.5 kilobytes or smaller than 100 bytes.

```sh
$ fsql "SELECT * FROM $GOPATH WHERE name = main.go AND (size >= 10.5kb OR size < 100)"
```
